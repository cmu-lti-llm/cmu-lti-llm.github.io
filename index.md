Carnegie Mellon University's Language Technologies Institute (CMU LTI) is excited to host a seminar exploring the world of Large Language Models (LLMs). Join us as we dive into the research, development, applications, ethics, and societal implications of these models.

We welcome attendees to engage with renowned experts, participate in thought-provoking discussions, and learn about the future of LLMs in academia, industry, and beyond. We will also host a hackathon for groups to explore and build an LLM-related idea. 

This page will document talks presented at this seminar, as well as fundamental problems around large language models and progress made during the hackathon sessions. 

The topics below are intended to serve as inspiration during the hackathon, don't feel like you need to limit yourselves to these topics. Feel free to interpret these as you wish.

### Hackathon ideas::

##### Studying data contamination
##### Studying multilingual capabilities
##### Fine-tuning vs. Prompting
